## About

Santiago's first ever robotics festival @ Lo Barnechea will be here in April of 2025! This will be a series of meetings where like-minded individuals and groups can share, learn, and have fun in a safe and supportive environment!

This website is developed as part of the FesRob project by one of the members of the team, [Hongmeng Zhai](https://github.com/Zhai90/) (that's me!), who has a burning passion for computer science (also me!).

Check out the team behind the project here. (team website todo)

This website was built using [NextJS](https://nextjs.org) and [Figma](https://figma.com), along with [shadcn\ui](https://ui.shadcn.com).
